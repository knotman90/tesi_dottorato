\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank \texttt{NVIDIA} corporation for providing the \textit{GTX980 GPU}
and \textit{Tesla K40} coprocessor I have used to carry out my research.

I would also like to thank also to Prof. Filippo Melascina from the Institute of BioEngineering of the University of Edinburgh (UK) who kindly gave access to the microscopy equipment and to Alice Mari who was of great help in providing the experimental raw data and subsequently in analyzing the results obtained in chapter \ref{ch:bacteria}.
