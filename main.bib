	abstract = "Abstract This chapter begins with a discussion on direct solvers. These include Gaussian elimination and its simplifications for banded systems, namely, the tridiagonal matrix algorithm and the pentadiagonal matrix algorithm. Following a discussion of the reasons why direct solution of large linear systems arising out of discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) is prohibitive, the reader is introduced to iterative solvers. Several iterative solvers are presented. These include the Jacobi method, the Gauss–Seidel method, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, the Stone’s strongly implicit method, the method of steepest descent, the conjugate gradient method, and the conjugate gradient squared method. All of the aforementioned methods are compared and contrasted by solving a benchmark boundary value problem. An overview of Krylov subspace methods is also included. Methods to linearize nonlinear source terms to attain diagonal dominance and stable convergence are also discussed. "

	Abstract = {Modern commodity processors such as GPUs may execute up to about a thousand of physical threads per chip to better utilize their numerous execution units and hide execution latencies. Understanding this novel capability, however, is hindered by the overall complexity of the hardware and complexity of typical workloads. In this dissertation, we suggest a better way to understand modern multithreaded performance by considering a family of synthetic workloads, which use the same key hardware capabilities – memory access, arithmetic operations, and multithreading – but are otherwise as simple as possible.
	
	One of our surprising findings is that prior performance models for GPUs fail on these workloads: they mispredict observed throughputs by factors of up to 1.7. We analyze these prior approaches, identify a number of common pitfalls, and discuss the related subtleties in understanding concurrency and Little’s Law. Also, we help to further our understanding by considering a few basic questions, such as on how different latencies compare with each other in terms of latency hiding, and how the number of threads needed to hide latency depends on basic parameters of executed code such as arithmetic intensity. Finally, we outline a performance modeling framework that is free from the found limitations.
	
	As a tangential development, we present a number of novel experimental studies, such as on how mean memory latency depends on memory throughput, how latencies of individual memory accesses are distributed around the mean, and how occupancy varies during execution.}

	abstract = { This paper presents the parallel implementation, using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) architecture, of the SCIARA-fv3 Complex Cellular Automata model for simulating lava flows. The computational model is based on a Bingham-like rheology and both flow velocity and the physical time corresponding to a computational step have been made explicit. The parallelization design has involved, among other issues, the application of strategies that can avoid incorrect computation results due to race conditions and achieving the best performance and occupancy of the underlying available hardware. Two hardware types were adopted for testing different versions of the CUDA implementations of the SCIARA-fv3 model, namely the GTX 580 and GTX 680 graphic processors. Despite its computational complexity, carried out experiments of the model parallelization have shown significant performance improvements, confirming that graphic hardware can represent a valid solution for the implementation of Cellular Automata models. }
