\lettrine[lines=4]{M}{ost} of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) arising from formulation of physical problems are very hard to solve analytically, requiring approximate numerical solutions.
An important part of handling and solving PDEs is to be able to use local, accurate and stable algebraics expression as an approximation of the derivatives appearing in the equations while retaining, at the same time, most of the global and continuous information of the original formulation.
During the last half century several approximation methods have been developed and studied, such as the finite volume (FV), finite element (FE), and finite difference (FD) methods (FDM), each with its specific approach to discretization and strength. 

This chapter briefly describes the concept of differential equations and introduces their numerical solution using the finite difference method. For a rigorous and complete description of the topic of this chapter please refer to \cite{doi:10.1137/1.9780898717839,CNM:CNM1630060303,Mazumder2016103}.

\section{Differential Equation}
A differential equation\cite{Larsoon:2004,Mcowen:2002} is an equation where the unknown is a function itself and where derivatives ot the unknown appears in the equation.
Differential Equations can be divided into two main classes:
\begin{description}
\item[Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE):] \hfil \\ where the unknown function contains only derivatives with the respect of a single variable. As example of ODE is the following equation,
\[
  \frac{d T}{d x} = \alpha T(x) +b
\] where $a$ and $b$ are real constants.

\item [Partial Differential Equations (PDE):] \hfil \\ a class that is extremely large and rich in functions, each of them with different behaviors and properties. Examples of classes of this kind of differential equations are \textit{parabolic}, \textit{elliptic} and \textit{hyperbolic} equations. PDEs search for a multidimensional function of several variables, and this means that partial derivatives may now appears in the equation. 
The following equations are among the most famous and popular PDEs:
   \begin{descritpion}
     \item [1D Transport Equation:] \hfil \\
     \begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} =0
     \end{equation}
     \item [1D diffusion equation:]\hfil \\ 
     \begin{equation}
     	\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}=0
     \end{equation} 
     \item [1D wave equation:]\hfil \\  
     	\begin{equation}
     	\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial t^2} -\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}=0
     	\label{eq:1dwave_equation}
     	\end{equation}
     	where $c$ is the speed of propagation. It can be applied to solve
     	\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{transverse string vibration} problem with $T$ representing the transverse displacement of the string, $c=\sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho A}}$ where $K,\rho$ and $A$ are the tension, density of the material and the cross area of the string.
			\item \textit{acoustic} with $T$ representing the pressure or the velocity of the considered fluid where $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.
			\item \textit{mambrane vibration}  with $T$ representing the transverse displacement of a membrane e.g. a drum head,$c=\sqrt{\frac{K}{m}}$ where $K,m$ are the tension and the mass per unit of area.
     	\end{itemize} 
     \item [Laplace's equation:]\hfil \\  
     	\begin{equation}
     	\nabla^2T = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2}+ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}=0
     	\end{equation}
     	where $\nabla^2$ is refeered to as the Laplacian operator and given by $$\nabla^2=\nabla \cdot \nabla = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$$ It often arises in fluid flow (where $T$ is the velocity potential), gravitational and bar torsion problems.
     \item [Heat equation:]\hfil \\  
     	\begin{equation}
     	 \rho c\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \kappa \nabla^2T +Q=0
     	\label{eq:heat_equation}
     	\end{equation}
     	where $k$ is the thermal conductivity (following from Fourier's law of heat conduction $q_x=-k\frac{dT}{dx}$ measured in $\frac{J}{s\, m^2}$, $Q$ is the internal heat, $c,rho$ are the material specific heat conduction parameter and density.
   \end{descritpion}
\end{description}

Note that there is a missing piece that would allow all these equations to be solved unequivocally, namely the initial condition and/or boundary. For example, regarding the $1$D wave equation (Equation \ref{eq:1dwave_equation}), it is not clear what the reflection coefficient at the ends of the string is, or with  regarding the heat equation (Equation \ref{eq:heat_equation}) what  the initial temperature at time $t=0$ is. 
\textit{Initial} conditions must be provided whenever the differential equation is time dependent and, \textit{boundary} conditions must be specified whenever spacial dependency occurs. The latter, in particular specifies the behavior of the equation at the boundary of the domain $\partial \Gamma$ (which has to be compact). The most commonly used boundary conditions defining a PDE are of two kinds:
\begin{description}
	\item [Dirichlet:] \hfil \\ in which the values of the functions at $\partial \Gamma$ are hard-coded, i.e. $T(\partial \Gamma)$  is known.
	
	\item [Neumann:] \hfil \\ specifies values of the derivatives at $\partial \Gamma$.
	
\end{description} 
Other kinds of boundary conditions are possible, such as for instance the Robin's boundary conditions\cite{Estep:1996:CDE:548037} which is a mix of Dirichlet and Neumann ones. See Figure \ref{fig:heat2d_bc} for an example of Dirichlet boundary conditions for the equation \ref{eq:heat_equation}.

\section{Finite Difference Method}
The finite difference approximation for derivatives is one of the simplest oldest methods to solve differential equations numerically. It is used since 1768 by \textit{L. Euler} to solve one dimensional problems and extended by \textit{C. Runge} to two dimensions in 1910. Since the advent of computers in 1950, FDM  popularity skyrocketed also thanks to the theoretical results that have been obtained regarding stability, convergence and other of its properties during the last five decades.

The general idea behind FDM is that the differential operator is approximated by replacing the derivatives using difference quotients. The differential operator is approximated constituting the field equation locally, among a number of finite function values. Therefore, the space and time domain are \textit{partitioned} in a grid-like fashion in order to store the local field quantities, and approximated solutions are computed only for those discrete grid points. The numerical solution is known only at a finite number of points in the physical domain. 
Difference quotients are a linear combination of function values at neighboring grid points. The number of different points appearing in the quotient directly dictates the order ot the differential operator.
We can always assume that the domain is discretized via a rectangular grid since we can always specify boundary conditions for the grid points such that they mimic the real shape of the boundary at hand, (see Figure \ref{fig:gridcustomshape}).
Complex geometries and curvilinear boundaries can be treated computing the value of such points that lie on the boundary as a linear interpolation of neighboring boundary \textbf{grid points} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gridcustom_shape2} and Equation \ref{eq:interpolateboundary}.

\begin{equation}
   T(R) = \frac{T_4(h-\delta) + T_0 \delta}{h} = g_0(R)
   \label{eq:interpolateboundary}
\end{equation}
where $g_0$ specifies the values at the boundaries.

	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:schematic_repr_fdm} is a schematic representation of how FDM is used to obtain a numerical solution. The continuous differential operators and the domain are discretized. The approximation is computed solving the difference formulas on grid points using.

    \label{fig:schematic_repr_fdm}
\end{figure}
    
    The error between the numerical solution and the exact solution is determined by the difference formula utilized and is commonly refeered to as \textit{truncation}\footnote{The term truncation comes from the fact that a finite difference quotient is a truncation of the Taylor expansion.} or \textit{discretization} error.  Increasing the resoution of the grid increases the accuracy of the numerical solution since the error associated with the finite difference formulas directly depends on the distance between grid points.
    
        
    Depending on how the derivatives are approximated, explicit or implicit FDM schemes are
    obtained. When forward difference formulas are considered, the
    resulting difference equation is generally expressed in terms of
    an explicit recurrence formula, while backward difference formulas
    generally lead to implicit recurrence formulas involving unknown
    values, and therefore require the solution of a linear system to
    obtain the new state of the system at each grid point.
    
    
\subsection{Finite Difference Formulas}
The differential operators appearing in a PDE problem can be approximated at a given point by a difference formula which is a linear function of its neighboring grid points. Finite difference formula can be defined and derived in a number of ways  but some of them are more widely and commonly used then others. The rest of this section shows how these common formulas are derived along with their basic properties. 

For the sake of simplicity the formulas are refereed to a one-dimensional space and time domain since the generalization to several dimensions is obvious.
Both space and time domains are partitioned into a finite discrete mesh as follows:    
 \begin{equation}
    		t_n = n\Delta t, \: n = 0,1,\ldots,L,\; \Delta t= \frac{1}{L}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
    		x_j = j\Delta x, \: j = 0,1,\ldots,M,\;\Delta x = \frac{1}{M}
    \end{equation}
For the rest of the chapter, it can be assumed that grid points are identified by two indices (see Figure \ref{fig:fdmheatequationstencil}) and $T_j^n$ is the value the function at time $n$ at grid point $j$.

\subsubsection{Forward Scheme}
    The \textit{forward} scheme is probably the most common FD formula and can be derived from Taylor's expansion of $T^n_{j+1}$ in terms of $T^n_{j}$ and its derivatives as:
    \begin{equation}
    T^n_{j+1} = T^n_{j} +
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\bigg\rvert^n_j \Delta x +
    \frac{1}{2!}  \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}\bigg\rvert_j \Delta x^2 + \ldots + 
     \frac{1}{k!}  \frac{\partial^k T}{\partial x^k}\bigg\rvert_j \Delta x^k + \ldots
     \label{eq:taylorexp1}
    \end{equation}    
    If series is truncated after the second term ($k=1$) and solving for $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$ the following is obtained:
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial T(t,x)}{\partial x}  = \frac{T^n_{j+1} - T^n_{j}}{\Delta x} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x)
    \label{eq:fdmforward}
    \end{equation}    
    Equation \ref{eq:fdmforward} is called \textbf{first order forward} finite difference approximation. Other approximations are possible and are easily obtainable by expanding different and/or more points of the grids in the Taylor's expression.
    
  \subsubsection{Backward Scheme}  
    The \textbf{Backward} finite difference quotient can be obtained from the Taylor's expansions of  $T^n_{j-1}$  in terms of $T^n_{j}$ and its derivatives:
    \begin{equation}
    T^n_{j-1} = T^n_{j} - 
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\bigg\rvert_j \Delta x +
    \frac{1}{2!}  \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}\bigg\rvert_j \Delta x^2 + \ldots + 
     \frac{1}{k!}  \frac{\partial^k T}{\partial x^k}\bigg\rvert_j \Delta x^k + \ldots
     \label{eq:taylorexp2}
    \end{equation}    
    which can be rearranged in the following manner
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\bigg\rvert_j  = \frac{T^n_{j} - T^n_{j-1}}{\Delta x} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x)
    \label{eq:fdmfbackward}
    \end{equation}
    
   The same approach can be used to derive approximation for higher order derivatives.
   For example equation \ref{eq:fdmcentral}, known as \textbf{central difference formula}, is an approximation for the second order derivative and can be obtained retaining the first four terms in both equations \ref{eq:taylorexp1} and \ref{eq:taylorexp2} and adding the resulting expression:   
    \begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}\bigg\rvert_j = \frac{T^n_{j+1}- 2T^n_{j} + T^n_{j-1}}{\Delta x^2} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)
		\label{eq:fdmcentral}
    \end{equation}    
    Figure \ref{fig:geometrical_intepretation} shows how finite difference formulas can be interpreted geometrically.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{./images/CA_FDM/geometrical_interpretation_fd}
	\caption{Explicit FDM discretization for the 1D heat conduction problem}
	\label{fig:geometrical_intepretation}
\end{figure}     
Note that this approach in deriving FD formulas can be generalized in order to obtain FD approximation for derivatives of any order.

 \subsubsection{Mixed Derivatives}

Mixed derivatives con also be approximated using FDM, e.g. for two dimensions by means of the following property of mixed derivatives:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \Bigg{(}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\Bigg{)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \Bigg{(}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\Bigg{)}\\
\end{equation}
and considering the following approximations: \hfil \\
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\scalebox{1.1}{
\begin{cases}
&\frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x \partial y} = 
\frac{\bigl(\frac{\partial T}{ \partial y}\bigr)_{i+1,j}\, - \,
	\bigl(\frac{\partial T}{ \partial y}\bigr)_{i-1,j}
}{2\Delta x} +\mathcal{O}(\Delta x)^2 \\
&\bigl(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\bigr)_{i+1,j} = \frac{T_{i+1,j+1} -T_{i+1,j-1}}{2\Delta y}+\mathcal{O}(\Delta y)^2 \\
&\bigl(\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\bigr)_{i-1,j} = \frac{T_{i-1,j+1} -T_{i-1,j-1}}{2\Delta y}+\mathcal{O}(\Delta y)^2 \\
\end{cases}
}
\end{equation}

\end{center}
A second order 2 variables finite difference approximation for the mixed derivative is the following:
\begin{equation}
\Bigg{(}\frac{\partial ^2 T}{\partial x \partial y}\Bigg{)}_{i,j}= \frac{T_{i+1,j+1} -T_{i+1,j-1} - T_{i-1,j+1} -T_{i-1,j-1}}{4\Delta x \Detla y} +\mathcal{O}((\Delta x)^2,(\Delta y)^2)
\end{equation}
Extending the former method to higher dimensional mixed derivatives is straightforward.

    %------------------HEAT Equation-------------------------------
\section{Heat Equation}
        As an example, a simple FDM scheme for the heat conduction initial-boundary value problem shown in Equation \ref{eq:heatconduction} is derived. 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial T(t,x)}{\partial t}= \kappa\frac{\partial^2
      T(t,x)}{\partial x^2}
      \label{eq:heatconduction}
\end{equation} 
    where $0 \leq t \leq L$ and $0 \leq x \leq M$. 
    
 In order to construct a FD approximation for equation \ref{eq:heatconduction} it is necessary to:  
 \begin{enumerate}
  
  \item discretize the domain into a finite uniform and regular mesh where each point $x_j$ is identified with a unique index $j$.
   
 \item  first and second order derivative appearing in Equation \ref{eq:heatconduction} are substituted by forward and central difference formulas, respectively, leading to Equation \ref{eq:discretizedheatequation} 
 
 \begin{equation}
  \frac{T^{n+1}_{j} - T^n_{j}}{\Delta t} = \kappa \frac{T^n_{j+1}- 2T^n_{j} + T^n_{j-1}}{\Delta x^2}
 \label{eq:discretizedheatequation}
 \end{equation}
 
 \item Equation \ref{eq:heatconduction} is evaluated at grid point $(n\Delta t, j \Delta x)$ 
    
\end{enumerate}    
Figure  \ref{fig:fdmheatequationstencil} depicts the set of points that play a role in the difference formula \ref{eq:discretizedheatequation}, commonly refeered to as the \textit{stencil}. Each point of the stencil is used at time $m$ in order to compute grid values at time $m+1$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:heat_equation_time_space_partitioning}.
\begin{figure}[b]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./images/CA_FDM/heatstencil}
  	\caption{Explicit FDM stencil for the considered discretization of the 1D heat conduction problem.}\label{torus}

\caption[1D-heat equation FDM space and time partitioning]{1D-heat equation FDM space and time partitioning. The solution for  grid point $(i,m+1)$ is explicitely computed by considering points $(i,m),(i-1,m),(i+1,m)$}
\label{fig:heat_equation_time_space_partitioning}
\end{figure}
Solution to equation \ref{eq:heatconduction} using the discretization \ref{eq:discretizedheatequation} is called \textit{forward time, centered space or FTCS} approximation and requires the specification of initial conditions at $t=0$ and boundary condition at $x=0$ and $x=M$ (see Figure \ref{fig:heat2d_bc}).

It can be shown that in order to the solution to be stable $\Delta t$ must not be too large and in particular the following condition must hold to ensure a stable solution \cite{isaacson:1994,anderson:1994,crank:1996}:
\[ 
 r= k \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}< \frac{1}{2}
\]
This scheme is also called \textit{explicit} because values at the subsequent  time step are explicitly computable from the values at the current time as it is shown in the equation \ref{eq:discretizedheatequation1}.
 \begin{equation}
  T^{n+1}_{j} = T^n_{j} + \frac{k \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} (T^n_{j+1}+T^n_{j-1}-2T^n_{j})
 \label{eq:discretizedheatequation1}
 \end{equation}

%%backward heat equation
When the backward difference formula is used to approximate the time derivative the following approximation is obtained:
 \begin{equation}
  \frac{T^{n}_{j} - T^{n-1}_{}}{\Delta x} = k \frac{T^n_{j+1}- 2T^n_{j} + T^n_{j-1}}{\Delta x^2}
 \label{eq:discretizedheatequation_implicit}
 \end{equation}
 This stepping scheme is called \textit{implicit} because values at time $n$ are given implicitly as can be seen if equation \ref{eq:discretizedheatequation_implicit} is rearranged to obtain the following: 
 \begin{equation}
T^n_{j} - \frac{k \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} (T^n_{j+1}+T^n_{j-1}-2T^n_{j}) =   T^{n-1}_{j}
 \label{eq:discretizedheatequation1}
 \end{equation}
 In order to obtain values of $T$ at time $n$ a system of non trivial algebraic equations has to be solved. 
 It can be rewritten in matrix form yielding to a linear tridiagonal system as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tridiagonal_matrix}.

    %%XCA and finite difference method-----------------------------------
\section[Solving FDM with XCA]{Solving Finite Difference Problems FDM with Extended Cellular Automata}
    XCA can be employed for both explicit and implicit schemes to formally
    represent FDM models. In fact, with reference to the definitions given in Chapter \ref{ch:CA}, in case of an
    explicit scheme, the computational domain can be represented by
    means of the $R$ cellular space and the coordinates of the grid
    points involved in the recurrence formula defined by means of the
    $X$ neighborhood relationship. Moreover, the values of the involved
    variables can be represented in terms of substates and the
    explicit recurrence formula easily expressed in terms of
    elementary processes. On the other hand, when dealing with a linear system
    resulting from an implicit FDM scheme, a steering function can be
    employed in association with an
    external linear algebra solver e.g. BLAS\cite{2002:USB:567806.567807} or other dedicated libraries\cite{Kestur:2010:BCF:1848074.1848496} .

    It is worth to recall that physically-based models laying on a XCA
    direct discrete approach (i.e., not going through the
    discretization of differential equations) can lead to the same
    discrete formulations achieved with the FDM, making these latter
    formulations a specific case of the general XCA
    approach. \cite{Mendicino2006} proved that
    their direct discrete formulation of the Darcy equation for
    modelling unsaturated flow in a three-dimensional cubic cell
    system is similar to the one achieved using an explicit FDM or a
    finite volume scheme. However, the same discrete governing
    equation system would allow a greater level of convergence with
    respect to traditional methods if an irregular mesh were used
    and a not linear (e.g., quadratic) interpolation of the hydraulic
    head on the cells were adopted (e.g., \citeauthor{Tonti2001237} proved it for the Finite  Element Method \cite{Tonti2001237}).
