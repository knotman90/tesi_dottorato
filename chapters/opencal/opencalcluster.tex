\lettrine[lines=3,lhang=0.33,lraise=0,loversize=0.15]{F}{or} most problems in physics and engineering there is a huge demand in improving the time needed to solve a certain problem. For instance some numerical meteorological models are so complex that even executed on powerful computers the execution time would be so long that by the time the result are available the prediction would be of no practical use. But speed is not the only important factor in scientific computing. Sometimes the accuracy of a solution need to be improved and that usually translates to a bigger and more dense discretization of the problem. It is clear that in order to overcome these limitations more computing power needs to be employed. 
%\section{Introduction}

Nowadays, computing systems are often equipped with more than one GPU. From high-end workstation, that are able to accommodate up to 8 GPUs or more on the same motherboard to large clusters, that are usually composed of several computing nodes (see Figure \ref{fig:distribuiteMemory} and Section \ref{sec:flynn_tax} at page \pageref{fig:distribuiteMemory} and \pageref{sec:flynn_tax} respectively) each of them equipped with one or more accelerators possibly of different kind and nature. Programming distributed memory machines is complex especially for non HPC computer scientist because of the intrisic complexity introduced by the parallelism and because of the hardware heterogeneousness, and this is especially true since large cluster are equipped with several accelerators. However is important to fully and effectively utilize such computing power, especially since having multiple GPUs per node improves the ratio performance over Watt and  price over Watt. For these reasons multi-GPU programming is becoming more and more important.

Unfortunately, neither \textsc{CUDA} or \textsc{OpenCL} supports natively a multi-GPU model. The model they support is based on a \textit{single core}-\textit{single GPU} relationship and works really well for tasks that are independent one from the other.
On the other hand, the aforementioned model makes things  more difficult when a task need to have several GPUs cooperate in some way in order to solve a problem instance.
As an example of an application of the supported model, the \textsc{BOINC} application \cite{anderson:2004} allows a user to donate computing power and time to solve relevant problems. In a multi GPU environment, it works spawning $N$ independent tasks and each of them is scheduled on one of the $N$ available GPUs.
When a task is finished, the application simply requests another task to the central server, the task dispatcher. No cooperation or communication is required between the GPUs as the tasks to be solved is self-contained, meaning that it does not need any external input or information.
An example of the unsupported model, consider the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) \cite{McNamara&Zanetti-1988} \cite{Aidun2010439} \cite{Higuera&Jimenez-1989} method on a domain that is decomposed along one axis, let's say the $x$ axis, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:multigpu_domain_decomposition}, so that each GPU is responsible for a subset of the whole mesh. Computation for a grid point that lies on the boundary of the domain portion assigned to the GPU $2$ needs information about neighboring points that are stored on different GPUs ($1$ and $3$ in this case).
Communication of such boundary points between the two devices is required.

\section{OpenCAL cluster}
This chapter described the distributed version of OpenCAL, OpenCAL cluster, which has been designed to take advantage of the modern multi-GPU capabilities of multi-node systems. This makes OpenCAL applications deployable on a variety of computer architectures, from a single CPU workstation to a large heterogeneous clusters. 
Section \ref{sec:configuration_file} starts by describing the \textit{configuration file} that is used to dispatch data and computation across the machine. Then, Sections \ref{}and \ref{}  outline the adopted parallelization and domain decomposition strategies. Section \ref{} introduces a set API and number of examples that show how it can used to code OpenCAL cluster applications. Finally, Section \ref{sec:perfomance} discusses performance and tests.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Run Configuration}
\label{sec:run_configuration}
Each OpenCAL application is attached with a running configuration that is provided by the user or the programmer and describes both which computational resources are going to be used during the execution and how the domain is be decomposed among them.
The running configuration is provided as a plain text file which syntaxt and structure is described in Listing \ref{code:file_syntax}.

\caption{File Format for  the OpenCAL cluster. It describes the size of the domain and the machine on which the model is executed. Note that for each node of the cluster, the IP address and a list of devices is listed. Each device is identified, \textit{\`a la} \textsc{OpenCL}, by platform and device number (within the platform).}
\end{table*}
%table name back to normal
\captionsetup[table]{name=Table}

The configuration file starts with two lines describing:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The size of the domain along each of the dimensions as a list of positive integers.
	\item The number $N$ of computational nodes, each described and identified uniquely by its IP address.
\end{enumerate}
$N$ descriptions of nodes follows.
A node $i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$ is described by a line containing its IP address $IP_i$ and the number of devices (installed and available on that node) $NUM\_GPU\_NODE_i$ to be utilized.
$NUM\_GPU\_NODE_i$ lines follows, each containing the definition of the devices within node $i$ and its workload. 

A device is identified by its \textbf{platform number} $PLATFORM\_NUMBER_p$, $1 \leq p \leq M_i$, where $M_i$ is the number of the platforms on node $i$, a \textbf{device number within the platform} $DEVICE\_NUMBER_l$ ($l$ relative to the platform). A \textbf{load} parameter for the device $d$, $LOAD^i_{(p,d)}$ describing the amount of work assigned (portion of the domain) to that device.

The list of devices within a node can be arbitrarly ordered.



\subsection{Domain Decomposition}
\label{sec:domain_decomposition}
In this preliminary work, the general strategy for dividing work among the available nodes and devices is to decompose the domain along the first dimension listed in the run configuration. The configuration file has to correctly describe a $1D$ decomposition along the first dimension of the domain. That means that the following has to be always true:
\[
\sum_i^N \sum_p^{M_i} \sum_d^{K_p} LOAD^i_{(p,d)} = DIM\_1
\]
i.e. the sum of the loads has to  match the size of the first dimension of the domain exactly. This ensures that the whole domain is assigned to some device on a node.

The decomposition follows the order in which nodes and devices are listed in the configuration file. Subsequent portions of not yet assigned portions of the domain are assigned to subsequent (with the respect to the order in which they appear in the file) devices. The size of such portion is described by the device load parameter.

 In order to show how decomposition works, consider the  configuration file in Listing \ref{code:configuration_file_example}.
\lstset{
 	caption={Configuration file example. Size of the domain is $16384 \times 16384$, scattered along the first dimension among $2$ nodes and $5$ device overall.},

\end{minipage}
which defines a $2D$ domain of size $2^{{14} \times 2^{{14}} = 2^{28}}$ points.
The domain is scattered along the first dimension, $x$, among 2 nodes and 5 devices, in the following manner:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $0 \leq x < 4096 \longmapsto$  device $(0,0)$ running at node $192.168.1.111$.
	\item  $4096 \leq x < 4096+4099$ go to device $(0,1)$ running at node $192.168.1.111$.
	
	\item  $4096+4096\leq x < 1200+4096+4096 \longmapsto$  device $(0,0)$ running at node $192.168.1.222$.
	\item  $1200+4096+4096\leq x < 3200+1200+4096+4096 \longmapsto$  device $(1,0)$ running at node $192.168.1.222$.
	\item  $3200+1200+4096+4096\leq x < 3792+3200+1200+4096+4096 \longmapsto$  device $(1,1)$ running at node $192.168.1.222$.
\end{itemize}



Generally speaking using the decomposition described in section \ref{sec:domain_decomposition} when $N$ devices are involved, GPU $i$ needs to know, for the update of the grid points within the boundaries of its subdomain, the value of substates of the neighboring subdomains belonging to different devices (that can be possibly located in different nodes). 
At each iteration, it must perform all the operations depicted in Figures \ref{fig:communication_scheme} and \ref{fig:multigpu_naive_exchange} (assuming periodic boundary conditions for the sake of simplicity).

		\label{fig:multigpu_naive_exchange}
\end{figure}


Note that this approach always requires CPU intervention as the OpenCL device-device memory transfer feature in the current implementation only works between devices that are within the same OpenCL context. This implies that synchronization is also required during the boundary exchange, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:multigpu_naive_exchange}b.
For a communication step to take place, it is necessary to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pack and upload boundary data to the CPU ( device$\,\mapsto\,$host  memory transfer)
	\item If the two GPUs involved in the communications are controlled by different nodes, an extra communication step over the network is performed between the two nodes. This phase is implemented via MPI \cite{mpiStandard:1994} to ensure and garantee portability and scalability. 
	\item Unpack and upload boundary data to the receipent GPU (host$\,\mapsto\,$device memory transfer).
\end{enumerate}


\section{The OpenCAL cluster Parallel Implementation}
  In this section, OpenCL cluster parallel implementation
of OpenCAL is described, which allows for the parallel execution on one or more accelerators installed on computing nodes interconnected via network and MPI.
This section describes the difference between OpenCAL-CL and OpenCAL cluster and discusses only the set of the additional API calls that the cluster version exposes. 

The programming model adopted by OpenCAL cluster is similar to the other versions of OpenCAL (see Section \ref{ch:opencal}) but it introduces new concepts that mainly reflect the multi-GPU and multinode structure of the target machines.

The main difference is the addition of the \texttt{MultiNode} class (see Listing \ref{code:multinode}).
\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption={OpenCAL cluster MultiNode Class Declaration}, 
	label={code:multinode}, 
	basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
	keywordstyle=\color{blue}\ttfamily,
	stringstyle=\color{red}\ttfamily,
	commentstyle=\color{green}\ttfamily,
	backgroundcolor=\color{light-gray}, 
}
\begin{lstlisting}
template <class Init_Functor,class Finalize_Functor>
class MultiNode{
public:
	Cluster c;
	Init_Functor *init;
	Finalize_Functor *finalize;
		...
\end{lstlisting}
It manages communications and computations across nodes and across GPUs and must be constructed by all the processes/nodes.

In order to use OpenCAL  cluster a  valid domain decomposition must be specified, see Section \ref{sec:domain_decomposition} and \ref{sec:run_configuration}.
The Domain Decomposition format described in section \ref{sec:domain_decomposition} is reflected in the OpenCAL implementation with the following classes:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{Device}] described by $4$ non-negative integers, two of which identify the device  within the node (using the OpenCL idiom of platform and device numbers) while the rest describe the portion of the subdomain assigned to the specific device.
	\item[\texttt{Node}] containing an IP address, a integer values describing the portion of subdomain assigned to it and finally, a list of \texttt{Device}s installed on the machine that are used for the computation.
	\item [\texttt{Cluster}] containing a list of \texttt{Node}s that are concurrently used to  execute an OpenCAL application.
\end{description}
Each OpenCAL cluster application necessitates of a \texttt{Cluster} object correctly initialized that can conveniently constructed from a file using the \texttt{calFromClusterFile} function exposed. Given a configuration file, it  \texttt{calFromClusterFile} parses, validates and finally returns a valid \texttt{Cluster} instance.

The information stored in the \texttt{Cluster} object is then utilized by each MPI process to allocate and to initialize all the listed devices.
The library is designed s.t. each MPI process runs several instances of  OpenCAL-CL (see Section \ref{sec:OpenCAL-CL}), each executing on different device and on a different portion of the original subdomain.
Note also that, OpenCAL cluster degenerate to OpenCAL-CL when only one none and one device are utilized, and that a multi-GPU single node configuration is obtainable specifiying a single node with several devices in the configuration file.

Devices within a node are managed by a \texttt{CALCLMultiGPU} object,  which  coordinate them and can be created using the \texttt{calclMultiGPUDef2D} API call. \texttt{CALCLMultiGPU} takes care of storing hooks to a per node's devices and resources as the list of compiled kernels for each devices.
It also exposes a number of functions for adding or removing a device from the pool and for boundaries exchange between two devices. 


\subsection{\texttt{Init} and \texttt{finalize} functors}
Listing \ref{code:multinode} shows that the \texttt{MultiNode} object, among others fields, contains a \texttt{Cluster} object and two pointers to functors which type is shown in listing \ref{code:init_finalize_signature}.
\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption=OpenCAL cluster init and finalize functor signature, 
	label={code:init_finalize_signature}, 
	basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
	keywordstyle=\color{blue}\ttfamily,
	stringstyle=\color{red}\ttfamily,
	commentstyle=\color{green}\ttfamily,
	backgroundcolor=\color{light-gray}, 
}
\begin{lstlisting}
void finalize(struct CALCLMultiGPU*);
void init(struct CALCLMultiGPU*, const Cluster*);
\end{lstlisting}

\texttt{init} and \texttt{finalize} if defined, are executed by each MPI process (Node) at the initialization and finalization phases, respectively.
Their definition is optional. They can be employed to perform operations that are hard to manage automatically on a per node basis. For example a certain node might need a particular initialization phase such as module loading for instance. The library can completely hide the initialization and allocation phases, but it is important to note that this behaviour can be changed and manual initialization can be enabled. When it is the case, the init functor can be employed to take car of making sure that each MPI process allocates all of its listed devices with the right resources in order to process the assigned domain. 

Listing \ref{code:init} shows an example of init function that is part of the Opencal Julia Set generator example application shown in section \ref{sec:julia_set} and in listing \ref{code:julia_set}. It shows how manual initialization can be performed from the configuration file. Each nodes access its own list of devices using its MPI rank (lines 3-4)  and add them all to the pool using the \texttt{calclAddDevice} function (lines 7-11).
\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption=OpenCAL cluster finalize example code for the Julia Set generator application. It outputs the node's portion of a substate to a file., 
	label=code:init,

	commentstyle=\color{green}\ttfamily,
	backgroundcolor=\color{light-gray}, 
	numbers=left,numbersep=3pt,, 
	numberstyle=\tiny
}
\begin{lstlisting}
void init(struct CALCLMultiGPU* multigpu, const Cluster* c){
	//add devices from the cluster configuration
	Node mynode = c->nodes[rank];
	auto devices = mynode.devices;
	struct CALCLDeviceManager* calcl_device_manager = calclCreateManager();
	calclSetNumDevice(multigpu, devices.size());
	for (auto& d : devices) {
		calclAddDevice(multigpu, 
			calclGetDevice(calcl_device_manager, d.num_platform, d.num_device),
			d.workload);
	}
	//create the model	
	struct CALModel2D* host_CA =
	calCADef2D(mynode.workload, mynode.columns, CAL_MOORE_NEIGHBORHOOD_2D, CAL_SPACE_TOROIDAL, CAL_NO_OPT);
	//add the substate
	Q_fractal = calAddSubstate2Di(host_CA);
	//gosh cells radius
	int borderSize = 1;
	calclMultiGPUDef2D(multigpu, host_CA, KERNEL_SRC, KERNEL_INC,
					 borderSize, mynode.devices, c->is_full_exchange());
	calclAddElementaryProcessMultiGPU2D(multigpu, 	KERNEL_LIFE_TRANSITION_FUNCTION);
}
\end{lstlisting}
Listing \ref{code:init} shows also that cluster object is used to eventually configure a \texttt{calclMultiGPUDef2D} object (line 19). 
Note that the decomposition along the first dimension of the domain is clear here. A CALModel2D object is created using the node's workload (the number of rows in this case).

The finalize functor is executed, if defined, at the end of the computation at the node level. Listing \ref{code:finalize} shows an example in which the \texttt{finalize} is used to save a per node copy of the grid to a file.
\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption=OpenCAL cluster init and finalize functor signature, 
	label=code:finalize, 
	basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,
	keywordstyle=\color{blue}\ttfamily,

	commentstyle=\color{green}\ttfamily,
	backgroundcolor=\color{light-gray}, 
	numbers=left,numbersep=3pt,, 
	numberstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{gray}
}
\begin{lstlisting}
void finalize(struct CALCLMultiGPU* multigpu){
//for each node, save the substate to a file
std::string fractal_str = "./fractal_portion" + std::to_string(rank)+".txt";
	calSaveSubstate2Di(multigpu->device_models[0]->host_CA, fractal_substate, (char*)fractal_str.c_str());
}
\end{lstlisting}
Note that an implicit MPI barrier is present right before the execution of the \texttt{init} and \texttt{finalize} call.

A MultiNode is used in user code as shown in listing \ref{code:multinode_user_code}
\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption=OpenCAL cluster init and finalize functor signature, 
	label={code:multinode_user_code},

}

\begin{lstlisting}
	//Construct a MultiNode object
	MultiNode<decltype(init), decltype(finalize)> mn(cluster, mpi_world_rank, init, finalize);
	//trigger allocation and init execution
	mn.allocateAndInit();
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Kernel Side }
Kernel side  API  and \textit{build-in} variables are added. Those additional variables and functions can be used to access and manage boundary cells belonging to neighboring devices, the so call \textit{ghost cells}. Each device keep an updated copy of  neighboring devices boundaries and offers to the programmer the abstraction of single domain. A \textit{built-in} variable, \texttt{border\_radius} is exposed in the kernel side, and can be used, from within the kernel, to retrieve the size of boundaries.

Listing \ref{code:sciddica_border} shows as an  example  of how \texttt{border\_radius}.


The following sections provides examples of usage of OpenCAL cluster. Section \ref{sec:opencal_julia} provides a complete code that generates large \texttt{BMP} images of Julia Sets.
Section \ref{sec:convolutional_filters_example} shows how to apply a Sobel's convolutional filter to a large 2D image.
Section \ref{sec:opencal_cluster_sciddicaT} shows an implementation of \textit{sciddicaT}, described in Section \ref{sec:SciddicaT-naive}. 
\section{OpenCAL Cluster High Resolution Julia Set Generation}
\label{sec:opencal_julia}
As a first illustrative example of the usage of OpenCAL cluster this section shows an application which generates high resolution Julia Set images running on an heterogeneous cluster of GPUs.

\subsection{Julia Set}
\label{sec:julia_math}
Julia set fractals are normally generated by initializing a complex number  $z = x + yi$  where  $i2 = -1$  and $x$ and $y$ are image pixel coordinates. Then, $z$ is repeatedly updated using:
\[ 
 z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]  
where $c$ is a complex constant that gives a specific Julia set (see Figure \ref{fig:julia_set_c}).

In the broader sense the exact for of the iterated function may be almost anything of the form $z_{n+1} = f(z_n)$. Interesting sets arises with non-linear functions. Commonly used ones include the following:
\begin{align*}
z_{n+1} &= c\, sin(z_n) & z_{n+1} &= c \,exp(z_n)\\
z_{n+1} &= i\,c\, cos(z_n) &z_{n+1} &= c\, z_n(1-z_n)
\end{align*}

A point is said to be part of the set if after the repeated iteration does not tent to infinity.
The fractal  is created by first mapping each pixel to a rectangular region of the complex plane. Each pixel represents the initial value of $z_0$. The series is computed for each pixel and if it does not diverge to infinity it is drawn in black, if it doesn't then a color is choosen depending on the number of iteration taken to diverge. This convergence or otherwise isn't always obvious and it may take a large number of iterations to resolve so a decision procedure is required to determine divergence. This typically involves assuming the series tends to infinity as soon as its value exceeds some value, if the series has not diverged after a certain number of terms it is similarly assigned to be part of the set. Both these decisions can be varied to give more precise images but ones that take longer to calculate. 

\subsection{Julia Sets OpenCAL Cluster implementation}
In order to generate the fractal, for each pixel the information regarding how many steps are necessary to diverge is stored in a single integral substate.
In order to compute this value the iterative process described in Section \ref{sec:julia_math} is implemented in listing \ref{code:julia_set} and is run once for each pixel of the final image.

Since OpenCAL uses OpenCAL-CL it is not surprising that source code and execution is divided in \textit{host} and \textit{device}(kernels), parts ( see Section \ref{sec:OpenCAL-CL}).  

Host side code is shown in listing \ref{code:julia_set_host}. Note that \texttt{init} and \texttt{finalize} functions are omitted since are already shown in listings \ref{code:init} and \ref{code:finalize}.
The applications takes as input parameter a configuration file that describes the size and the partitioning of the domain among the nodes and the devices of the cluster. It constructs a \texttt{Cluster} objects out of it using the \texttt{fromClusterFile} function.
The MultiNode class is then created (line 13), and used to allocate  (line 14) and eventually starts the executions (line 17).

The \texttt{run} function takes care of splitting the domain and handle communication among the devices transparently. This means that at each iteration the code shown in Listing \ref{code:julia_set} is executed on each device and on each point of the grid assigned to it. Note that in this example, boundaries communication is not required, since no neighboring values are needed in order to compute the value for a pixel.

\subsection{Convolutional Filters}
\label{sec:convolutional_filters}
The example presented in this section is an application that applies a the sobel convolutional filter on a large 2D image. The code presented can be trivially extendend in order to support any kind of convolutional filter also on domain with more dimensions.

 \begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{./images/opencal/kernel_functions}
		\caption{Common point spread functions. The Pillbox (a), Gaussian (b) and Square (c) are common smoothing, low-pass filters. Edge enhancement (d) is an example of high-pass filter. }
		\label{fig:kernel_functions}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
Convolution filtering is used to modify the spatial frequency
characteristics of an image. Its name derives from the term \textit{convolution} which is a general purpouse filter. It is applied to each  point of the domain and consists of determining the new value of the point  by adding weighted values of all its neighbors together, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:convolution}.
 \begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./images/opencal/kernel_convolution}
		\caption{The process of determining the new value of the central cell by applying a convolution matrix to its neighborhood.}
		\label{fig:convolution}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
Conovolution is performed multiplying the whole neighborhood of a point by a  matrix, the kernel of the convolution, which usually is a small square matrix of size $r$ (the most common size for kernels is $3\times 3$).
Kernels coefficients correnspond to pointwise values of a arbitrary fixed continuous function, called Point Spread Functions (PFS). Figure \ref{fig:kernel_functions} depicts some of the most common PFS.

Convolution is very often used in image processing. Examples in this field are the Sobel's edge detection filter and the Gaussian Blur filter, that are shown in Figures \ref{fig:gaussian} and \ref{fig:sobel}.


\begin{figure}
	\minipage{0.65\textwidth}

	\caption{Gaussian Convolution filter application. The emnployed Gaussian Kernel has radius $4$.}

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\endminipage\hfill
	\caption{Sobel edge detection filter. The new pixel value is computed in two subsequent steps, horizontal and vertical, in order the final image to be less affected by noise.}
	\label{fig:sobel}
\end{figure}

Formally convolution can be expressed by the following formula:
\begin{equation}
   f'_{ij} = \sum_{i'=0}^n (\sum_{j'i'=0}^m f_{(i+i')(j+j')}\times d_{ij})
   \label{eq:convolution}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $m,n$ are the  vertical and horizontal size of the kernel,
	\item $f_{ij}$ and $f'_{ij}$ are the old and new value of the cell at coordinate $(i,j)$,
	\item $d_{ij}$ is the value of kernel at location $(i,j)$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Edge Handling}
It is clear from Equation \ref{eq:convolution} that kernel convolution requires values from pixels outside the domain boundaries. There are a number of ways for handling these corner cases:
\begin{description}
	\item[Wrap] \hfill \\The image is conceptually treated as it was wrapped in a toroidal shape. OpenCAL natively deals with toroidal domain.
	\item[Mirror] \hfill \\
	The image boundaries are mirrored at the edges, maning that if trying to read a pixel 2 units outside the edges, the returned value is the corrensponding pixel 2 unit inside the edge instead.
	\item [Crop]\hfill \\
	The final image does not contain pixel which would require values from beyond the edges. The output is smaller than the input because edges have been cropped out.
\end{description}

\subsection{Sobel Edge Detection OpenCAL cluster implementation}
\label{sec:convolutional_filters_example}
Convolutional filtering is easily implemented in OpenCAL cluster in the following steps and has been applied to the image shown in Figure \ref{fig:sobel_input}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Image channels are separately read by each OpenCAL process into \texttt{short} substates (using any image reading third part library, as \texttt{SOIL} \cite{SOIL}, for instance).
    \item A cluster file is defined for the image and shown in listing \ref{code:sobel_cluster_file}. A single node and 3 GPUs were employed in this example. Two \texttt{NVIDIA GTX980} and one \texttt{NVIDIA K40} each with an equal workload.
    \item The kernels depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sobel} are applied to each pixel of the image. OpenCAL kernel code is shown in Listing \ref{code:sobel_kernel}.  Boundaries are automatically handled and transferred  between devices. When devices running on different nodes need to communicate then a MPI communication takes place.
    \item The resulting image is written on disk and  shown in Figure \ref{fig:sobel_result} (optimized for book format).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SciddicaT}
This section briefly describes the implementation of the \textit{SciddicaT} landslide model introduces in Section \ref{sec:sciddicaT_model}.
This example shows that it is possible to deploy any model written in OpenCAL-CL to OpenCAL cluster on multiple nodes and accellerators very easily. 
Code shown for the implementation of sciddicaT  in Section \ref{sec:sciddica_cl} is used in this section, with few lines added.
The additional lines take care of the definition of a cluster object, as shown in Listing \ref{code:sciddicat_configuration}, during of the initialization phase as shown in Listing \ref{code:sciddicat_initi}.
Note that in this example no configuration file is used, as to show that is possible to set up a configuration launch programmatically.

\lstset{language=[OpenCL]C,frame=tb,
	caption=OpenCAL cluster sciddicaT launch configuration set up programmatically during the init (see Section \ref{sec:init_finalize}) phase.,

}
\begin{lstlisting}
void setUpParallelWork(Cluster& mn, const uint XDIM, const uint YDIM){
	//------node 1
	struct Node n1;
	struct Device d1_0 = {0,0,XDIM/4}; //NVIDIA  GTX980
	struct Device d1_1 = {0,1,XDIM/4}; //NVIDIA  K40
	struct Device d1_2 = {0,2,XDIM/4}; //NVIDIA  K40	
	n1.devices.push_back(d1_0);
	n1.devices.push_back(d1_1);
	n1.devices.push_back(d1_2);
	//node workload's is the sum of its devices workloads
	n1.workload = d1_0.workload+d1_1.workload+d1_2.workload;
	n1.columns=C;
	n1.offset = 0;
	mn.nodes.push_back(n1);
	
	//------node 2
	struct Node n2;
	//remainder work to this device
	struct Device d2_0 = {0,0,XDIM/4+XDIM%4};//NVIDIA K20
	n2.devices.push_back(d2_0);
	n2.workload = d2_0.workload;
	n2.columns=C;
	//n2.workload starting from n1.workload
	n2.offset = n1.workload;
	
	mn.nodes.push_back(n2);
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this case, a configuration \texttt{Cluster} specifiying two nodes and 4 devices overall is created. The 4 devices employed are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $2$ \textsc{nvidia} K$40$
	\item $1$ \textsc{nvidia} K$20$
	\item $1$ \textsc{nvidia} GTX$980$
\end{itemize}
(see Appendix \ref{app:tech_spec} for the technical speficiation of the accelerators).

The initialization phase is used here in order to allocate and initialize the library using the same approach shown in Listing \ref{code:init} (lines 7-11).

The kernel side of the application remain the same too, with the exception that boundaries cells are not considered, and are only used in read mode. 

\section{Performance Analysis}
This section describes the computational results of \texttt{OpenCAL} cluster on the following benchmarks:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Julia Set} Generation, described in Section \ref{sec:julia_math}. It is a compute bound application.
	\item \textbf{Convolutional Filter} application, described in Section \ref{sec:convolutional_filters}, is an example of memory bound application.
	\item Landslide numerical model \texttt{\textbf{sciddicaT}}, introduced and formally defined in Section \ref{sec:sciddicaT_model} at page \pageref{sec:sciddicaT_model}, and is used to benchmark the performance of OpenCAL cluster on a real life computational model. Its kernels are both memory and compute bounds.
\end{enumerate}
Assessing the type of limiting factor for performance relatively short kernels as Julia Set generation and convolutional filter is relatively easy by considering the \textit{instruction:byte} rate of the considered kernel.
Each GPU is attached with a theoretical peak in memory and instruction throughputs\cite{Volkov:EECS-2016-143}.
Let $I$, in \si{GInst/s}, and $M$,in \si{GB/s}, be the peak instruction and memory throughput, respectively. The quantity $\frac{I}{M}$ is then called \textbf{balanced} \textit{instruction:byte} ratio. It is the number of \texttt{fp32} per byte that should be issued in order to obtain peak compute and bandwidth performance.
For example the GPU NVIDIA K40 has a theoretical instruction throughput of $715.2$ \si{GInstr/s} and a theoretical bandwidth of $288$ \si{GB/s}. 
Its theoretical instruction throughput is computed by considering the base clock of a single core, that is $F=745$ \si{MHz} and their number, that is $N=2880$. Assuming that a \texttt{fp32} operation is completed with a latency of $L=3$ cycles then the throughput is computed as follows:
\[
	\frac{\frac{F*2880}{1000}}{3} = \frac{745*2880}{3000} = 715.2
\]

The balanced ratio for the \texttt{K40} is then:\[\frac{715.2}{288} = 2.483\]
If, compared to the \textit{balanced} ratio for the device at hand, the \textit{instruction:byte} ratio of a kernel is: 
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Higher}]:\\usually means that the kernel is \textbf{instruction/compute} bound, while if it is
	\item[\textbf{Lower}]:\\usually mean that the kernel is \textbf{memory/bandwidth} bound.
\end{description}

The ratio for the Listing \ref{code:julia_set} has a value of roughly (assuming $MAXITERATION=10000$,and cost for \texttt{cl\_complex\_multiply} and \texttt{cl\_complex\_add} is equal to $2$ \texttt{fp32} instructions): $\approx 40000:1 >> 2.48$. Therefore, Listing \ref{code:julia_set} is a compute bound kernel for the $K40$ GPU.
For the same reasons we can conclude that kernel shown in Listing  \ref{code:sobel_kernel} is memory bound: its \textit{instruction:byte} ratio for is $\approx 1:1$:  

\subsection{Julia Set Generation}
Fractal Generation is an example of perfectly parallelizable problem, since the computation of each point of the grid does not require any communication and does not depend on the value of any other grid points other than itself. Moreover the granularity of the work is small, making it a good candidate for GPU acceleration.
The Julia generating function adopted is the following $z_{n+1} = z^2_n + c$ where $c=-0.391+-0.587i$. Each discrete point of the grid $(x,y)\; 0\leq x < S_x, 0\leq y < S_y$ is mapped to the complex plane using the following mapping:

\begin{align*}
	Re(z)=&\frac{3(x-\frac{S_x}{2})}{K S_x} \\
	Im(z)=&\frac{2(y-\frac{S_y}{2})}{K S_y}
\end{align*}
where $K$ is the zoom factor, $S_x$ and $S_y$ are the vertical and horizontal sizes, respectively, of the discrete computational grid.

Two domain sizes are considered:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{small}, consisting of  $12000 \times 12000 = 144 \times 10^6$ points, $10^3$ iterations limit per step.
		\item \textbf{large}, consisting of $17000 \times 17000 = 289 \times 10^6$ points, $10^4$ iterations limit per step.
	\end{itemize}
Note that besides its much higher number of grid points, the \textit{large} domain case performs $10 \times$ more work (in a single step) per grid point than the \textit{small} case as the number of iteration limit is increased from $10^3$ to $10^4$.

Table \ref{tab:julia_single_GPU} shows timings and speedup obtained on a single \texttt{NVIDIA K40} and \texttt{GTX980} on the \textit{small} damain.
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Timings and speedups obtained on a single \texttt{NVIDIA K40} and \texttt{GTX980}}
	\label{tab:julia_single_GPU}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
	\toprule
	& GTX980 & K40 \\ \midrule
	\textbf{Time}$(\si{\milli\second})$    & $10908$      & $2561$   \\
	\textbf{Speedup}($\times$) & $116$      & $496$  \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As expected speedup results are good, up to $\approx 500 \times$, thanks to the great parallelizability of the problem on GPU architecture.

Table \ref{tab:julia_two_GPU} and Figure \ref{fig:julia_two_GPU} show timings and speedups of the same application on two GPUs on the \textit{small} domain. Note that since the two devices adopted have substantial difference in hardware (see Table \ref{tab:tech_spec_nvidia}) it is not easy to determine in advance the best workload for each of the GPU in order to obtain the best load balancing. For this reason a number of experiments are performed in order to discover the optimal workloads for the considered GPUs and kernel.
The best speedup is obtained when only $25\%$ of the domain is assigned to the \texttt{GTX 980}.It can be seen that for this type of kernels, the $K40$ shows better performance, due to the fact that the \texttt{K40} has an higher number of processing cores and shows and better divergence management than the \texttt{GTX980}.
Moreover, it also worth to note that the Julia set kernel is highly divergent and that work is not homogeneously spread across the domain, as can be seen from  and from Figure \ref{fig:fractal16k16k}. Pixel coloured in blue correnspond to a small number of iteration of the loop in Listing \ref{code:julia_set}, lines 23-26, while the ones coloured in red to higher number of iteration.
Note that no communication whatsoever is performed during this application since, the problem is embarrassingly parallel.
The rightmost part of Figure \ref{fig:julia_two_GPU_true} (from $9000$ to $12000$) shows a weird fluctuation in the speedups that is mainly due to the fact that pixels contained in rows from $1000$ to $2000$ corrensponds to \textit{black} ones i.e. to pixel with almost no work attached to them.
In order to show that in the case of uniform work attached to each pixel the speedup curve behave normally, a variation of Listing \ref{code:julia_set} is used and shown in Listing \ref{code:julia_set_uniform} where each execution of the kernel is lasts for $1000$ iterations.
Figure \ref{fig:julia_two_GPU_false} shows that fluctuation in this case are not present.

Table \ref{tab:fractal12k_980_980} and Figure \ref{fig:fractal12k_980_980} show speedup and timings for the case where two identical GPUs \texttt{GTX980} are employed. 
It is not surprising that in this case best performance are achieved when the dataset is shared in a equal manner among the two devices. Timing and speed-up are not perfectly symmetrical in this case, as one should expect, because one of the GPU is attached with the (small) overhead of performing screen rendering.

In this case, the workload not assigned to the $K40$ is equally divided among the two $GTX980$ as this is the case where best performance are achieved when two identical devices are adopted, as shown in  Figure \ref{fig:fractal12k_980_980}.

Achieved speedup are good, up to to $\approx 110 \times$, when workload division is s.t. $\approx 20\%$ of the total work is shared among the two \texttt{GTX980} (see Figure \ref{fig:fractal12k_K40-980-980_true}). 
This is due to the non homogeneous distribution of the work along the domain and to the high number of divergent threads. Infact, when homogeneity of work if forced, i.e. all threads perform the same number of iterations, the best performance are obtained assigning $\approx 40\%$  of the domain  to the two \texttt{GTX980} (see Figure \ref{fig:fractal12k_K40-980-980_false}).

\subsection{Convolutional Filtering}
Convolutional filtering is not a perfectly parallelizable problem since grid points on the boundaries requires values from grid points that resides on different GPUs. The ratio of \textit{instruction:byte} is  usually low (it can vary depending on the convolutional kernel adopted), meaning that the problem is low compute intense and bandwith bound.
Two filtering operation are taking in consideration for assessing the performance of OpenCAL cluster on this kind of algorithm:
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Sobel Edge Detection}]:\\ Described in Section \ref{sec:convolutional_filters} and
	\item[\textbf{Gaussian Blur}]:\\ that consists of a  uniform matrix  with coefficients equal to $\frac{1}{9}$. At each step of the the application change the value of a grid point with the average of its $8$ immediate neighboring points. It has a \textit{instruction:byte} ratio $\approx 1$.
\end{description}

Dici che è compute bound e non del fatto che il lavoro non è uniforme sulla matrice 
commenta tempi di esecuzione e soprattuto che non era possibile arrivato ad un certo punto eseguire nessun filtro perchè la memoria non bastava


\subsection{Conclusion}
This mechanism is correct and it is the one that is currently implemented in OpenCAL but it is not optimal mainly because of the the serialization of communication and computation and the involvement of the host in each transfer between two GPUs.
